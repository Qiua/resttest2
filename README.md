# REST Test 2.0 - A Modern API Client

Project Demo - [https://resttest2.netlify.app/](https://resttest2.netlify.app/)

This is a fork of the wonderful project https://github.com/jeroen/resttesttest

A simple, fast, and modern web API client for making HTTP requests and inspecting responses. This project is a complete refactor of a legacy application, now built with a cutting-edge tech stack including React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.

## üöÄ About the Project

This project was born from the need to modernize an internal API testing tool. The goal was to create a robust, high-performance codebase with an excellent developer experience, ready for future expansion and open source contributions.

### ‚ú® Main Features

- **Multiple HTTP Methods:** Full support for GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, and more.
- **Resizable Panels:** Layout inspired by professional tools like Postman and Insomnia, with adjustable request and response panels.
- **Tabbed Interface:** Organize request details (Parameters, Authentication, Headers) and response (Body, Headers) in intuitive tabs.
- **Flexible Authentication:** Integrated support for:
  - Basic Auth
  - Bearer Token
  - API Key in Headers
- **File Uploads:** Support for `multipart/form-data` requests.
- **Syntax Highlighting:** Pleasant, colorful visualization for JSON responses.
- **Save and Load Requests:** Store your most used requests in the browser's `localStorage` for easy reuse.
- **Environment System:** Define variables like `{{baseUrl}}` to reuse in different contexts (development, production, etc.).
- **Collection Management:** Organize your requests into workspaces and collections for better structure.
- **Request History:** Keep an automatic log of requests with detailed statistics.
- **Proxy Settings:** Work around CORS limitations with support for different proxy types.

### üõ†Ô∏è Built With

- **[React](https://reactjs.org/)** - The library for building user interfaces.
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** - For safer, more maintainable code.
- **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)** - Extremely fast build tool.
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** - Utility-first CSS framework for modern, customizable styling.
- **[Axios](https://axios-http.com/)** - HTTP client for making requests.
- **[React Resizable Panels](https://react-resizable-panels.com/)** - For resizable layout panels.
- **[React Syntax Highlighter](https://github.com/react-syntax-highlighter/react-syntax-highlighter)** - For JSON syntax highlighting.

## üèÅ Getting Started

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/Qiua/resttesttest.git](https://github.com/Qiua/resttesttest.git)
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project folder:
    ```sh
    cd resttesttest
    ```
3.  Install dependencies:
